Object: Object is a living run-time entity .We can clearly understand what an object is by examining various objects .A cycle is an object .A Bike is an Object. Man is an Object and so on …let us see what made it as objects
> A Cycle has a name (attribute).A cycle has a chain (attribute) .A cycle contains pedals (attribute).we can use cycle for some functions like riding.(function). When we consider a man he will he will have a name(attribute),hands(attributes),legs(attribute)
Using his hands he will do some work (function)using his legs he will walk(function) and he has some more functions like running ,eating ,talking, sleeping, and so on(functions)…

> Man Object

Name
> Eyes
Hands	Legs
Walk()
Seeing()
Sleeping()
Eating()

So man cycle are Objects because they have some attributes and functions

Object= variables(attributes) +methods (functions)
> Functions are called as methods in java



Therefore we can define an object as a runtime entity (which will be created in the program execution


Class: Before knowing about a class first you should be familiar with object, which I explained above. A class is proto type or blue print of an object
Which are mostly equals to structs and unions in C++ C languages, with little differences
Class defines the object. The definition of object is class
Consider the following code in  JAVA


class demo1
{
int var1;
String var2;
void method1()
{
//method 1 Code
}
void mathod2()
{
// method 2 code
}
}
here demo1 is class name ,var1,var2 are variables of type int and String(don’t be confused or temper you will come to all these in following sections) and  method1(),method2() are methods

Data Types:

In our daily life, we use many things for many purposes .we use calculators for calculations. we use **for**.and so on. Like that , we create objects for several purposes which are described according to class definition. Therefore, that object is data type of that class .java provides eights built in data types or simple data types, or primitive data types. They are

> Primitive data types
> Numbers	Characters	Boolean
Integers		Floating points	char			boolean

byte short  int long 	float double
